Installation
============

There are two different ways to install pleione:

1. **Install pleione natively (Recommended).**

   *OR*

2. **Clone the Github repository.** If you are familiar with git, pleione can
   be cloned and the respective folder added to the python path. Further details
   are below.

Option 1: Install pleione natively on your computer
---------------------------------------------------

The recommended approach is to use system tools, or install them if
necessary. To install python packages, you could use pip, or download
the package from `python package index <https://pypi.org/project/pleione/>`_.

1. **Install with system tools**

   With pip, you simple need to execute and pleione will be installed on
   ``$HOME/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages`` folder or similar.

   .. code-block:: bash

	pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pleione --user

   If you have system rights, you could install pleione for all users with

   .. code-block:: bash

	sudo -H pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pleione

2. **Download from python package index**

   Alternatively, you could download the package (useful when pip fails to
   download the package) and then install with pip. For instance:

   .. code-block:: bash

	pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pleione --user

   .. note::
	**Why Python3?**:
	Pleione is intended to be used with python3, despite the lack of
	incompatible functions with python2, because the latter won't receive
	further development past 2020. Although, the code could be optimize with
	specific python3 functions over dictionaries, therefore making incompatible
	with python2.

   .. note::
	**pip, Python and Anaconda**:
	Be aware which pip you invoque. You could install pip3 with
	``sudo apt-get install python3-pip`` if you have system rights, or
	install python3 from source, and adding ``<python3 path>/bin/pip3`` to the
	path, or linking it in a directory like ``$HOME/bin`` which is commonly
	added to the path at system login. Please be aware that, if you installed
	Anaconda, pip could be linked to the Anaconda specific version of pip, which
	will install pleione into Anaconda's installation folder.
	Type ``which pip`` or ``which pip3`` to find out the source of pip, and type
	``python -m site`` or ``python3 -m site`` to find out where is more likely
	pleione would be installed.

Option 2: Clone the Github repository
-------------------------------------

1. **Clone with git**

   The source code is uploaded and maintained through Github at
   `<https://github.com/glucksfall/pleione>`_. Therefore, you could clone the
   repository locally, and then add the folder to the ``PYTHONPATH``. Beware
   that you should install the *pandas* package (`pandas`_) by any means.

   .. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/glucksfall/pleione /opt
    echo export PYTHONPATH="\$PYTHONPATH:/opt/pleione" >> $HOME/.profile

   .. note::
	Adding the path to ``$HOME/.profile`` allows python to find the package
	installation folder after each user login. Similarly, adding the path to
	``$HOME/.bashrc`` allows python to find the package after each terminal
	invocation.
